# Weekend #5 - MEAN Star Wars API Interface

A common task in dealing with data from an API is to create a user-friendly interface to access and find information. This weekend that's exactly what we'll be doing with a MEAN stack application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

npm install will add the necessary dependencies

    "angular": "^1.6.8",
    "angular-animate": "^1.6.8",
    "angular-aria": "^1.6.8",
    "angular-material": "^1.1.6",
    "angular-messages": "^1.6.8",
    "angular-route": "^1.6.8",
    "body-parser": "^1.18.2",
    "express": "^4.16.2",
    "express": "^5.0.1",
    "nodemon": "^1.14.11"

    <h1>OR COPY AND PASTE THE BELOW LINE INTO TERMINAL</h1>

npm install -- save angular@1.6.8 angular-animate angular-aria angular-material angular-messages angular-route body-parser express express nodemon

### What I learned

* Working with a simple API was great practice in learning how to get data and display it to the DOM
* Working with branches and framing in what I need to get up and runnning is becoming more comfortable

## What caused issues/problems I ran into

 * Underestimated the time necessary to complete the project
 * Need to practice and work more with services to get them to work fluidly
 * Learning more about AngularJS and what ng options are available is something I need to work with and become more comfortable
